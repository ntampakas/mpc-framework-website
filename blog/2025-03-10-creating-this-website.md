## About

After picking docusaurus, we decided we liked the look of https://eightshift.com/.

Happily, their website is open source, so I copied the code, included them in our LICENSE, and have just had to tweak it for our needs.

I'm a little disappointed TypeScript isn't used. I don't really do plain JS these days. Hopefully we'll upgrade [this repo](https://github.com/voltrevo/mpc-framework-website) to use TypeScript later.
